          Back in 2011, I decided to enroll in my high school's introductory
          computer science class. Fast-forward to today, and I've had the
          privilege of building software for a start-up and a government agency.
          My main focus these days is building full stack web applications. I
          most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and
          engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built well under
          the hood. When I'm away from my keyboard, I'm usually hiking, reading,
          and taking care of my cats.
